## Overview

VidTailor is an intelligent video learning platform that generates personalized practice questions by analyzing students' viewing behaviors, providing precise learning feedback and a social learning experience.

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Question Generation

- **Behavior-Driven Analysis**: Real-time identification of learning difficulties based on viewing behaviors (fast-forward, slow-motion, pause, replay, etc.)
- **Personalized Questions**: Automatically generates practice questions tailored to individual learning levels and weak points
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback to help students test and reinforce their understanding immediately

### 2. Smart Error Book & Note System

- **Video Segment Linking**: Precisely associates incorrect answers with corresponding video segments for one-click review
- **Knowledge Point Highlighting**: Automatically records errors and highlights key concepts to build a personal knowledge gap database
- **Synchronized Notes**: Smart note-taking feature addresses cognitive blind spots, improving review efficiency and knowledge system completeness

### 3. Social Learning Interaction

- **Smart Matching**: Recommendation algorithm pairs learners with similar questions or challenges
- **Topic Forums**: Guides students into relevant discussion groups to share insights and problem-solving approaches
- **AI Assistant**: Intelligent chat assistant helps discuss difficult problems and pushes relevant knowledge points
- **Learning Community**: Creates a collaborative learning atmosphere to boost motivation and engagement

## Design Methodology

### User Research & Iteration

- **Multi-Round Prototype Testing**: Scenario demonstration videos → Low-fidelity prototype interviews → Questionnaire surveys
- **A/B Testing**: Compares different interaction prompt schemes to optimize the balance between timeliness and distraction
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Continuously collects user feedback to iterate and optimize features and interface design

### Validation Results

- Significantly improved system usability (SUS satisfaction scores, task completion rates, etc.)
- Validated the effectiveness of personalized learning paths and social learning models
- Provided clear direction for future feature iterations
